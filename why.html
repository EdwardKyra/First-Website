  <h1>Why</h1>

 <p>
     Foster kids were born into their life-situations, to no fault of their own. When parents are deemed to be unfit to care for their kids, and no family member agrees to take the kids, then they are placed in foster care, ideally with a foster family but frequently older teens are placed into orphanage-like group homes.
    In their emancipation-year (18-21, depending on state,) they will lose their housing provided through foster care and will often become homeless on their birthday.
    The original mission of Techie Youth was to help foster kids become financially self-sufficient as rapidly as possible, so they are prepared for independent living. We have since expanded scope to also help severely-at-risk older-youth who are on a track towards homelessness or incarceration.
